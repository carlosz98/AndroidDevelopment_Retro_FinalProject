## Overview
RetroHub is an ambitious Android application, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, envisioned as a comprehensive platform for enthusiasts of retro video games, software, hardware, and their iconic soundtracks. It aims to be a community-driven hub where users can discover, share, and engage with content spanning from the early 2000s to
contemporary retro-inspired creations. Key features will include curated articles, a showcase of vintage and new videogame magazines, a streaming service for game soundtracks, and user accounts for personalized experiences and content contribution.

The project leverages modern Android development practices, emphasizing a clean, retro-themed aesthetic and a user-friendly interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts (Current & Planned)

- **Language**: Kotlin (100%)
- **Core Android & Jetpack Libraries**:
    *   **Jetpack Compose**: UI Toolkit (Material 3, Layouts, Navigation, Pager, Graphics, Animation).
    *   **`WebView` (via `AndroidView`)**: Initial display of web-based magazine content.
    *   **ExoPlayer / Android Media3 (Planned)**: For robust audio streaming of game soundtracks.
    *   **Room Database (Planned)**: For local caching of user preferences, offline articles, or metadata.
    *   **Retrofit / Ktor (Planned)**: For type-safe HTTP communication with the backend API.
    *   **Jetpack Navigation Compose (Planned)**: For all in-app navigation.
    *   **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For managing asynchronous operations and reactive data updates throughout the app.
    *   **Hilt / Koin (Planned)**: For dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively.
    *   **Coil / Glide (Planned)**: For efficient image loading and caching (covers, article images, album art).
- **Backend Infrastructure (Conceptual - Requires Separate Development)**:
    *   A dedicated **RESTful API** (e.g., built with Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Kotlin/Ktor, Spring Boot).
    *   A **Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) to store user accounts, articles, magazine metadata, album information, and user-generated content links.
    *   **Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage, Google Cloud Storage)** for hosting uploaded media files (magazine scans, album audio files - if not streamed from existing sources).
- **UI/UX Principles**:
    *   Declarative UI paradigm.
    *   State Hoisting and Unidirectional Data Flow in Compose.
    *   Material Design 3 guidelines adapted to the retro theme.
    *   Accessibility considerations.
- **Data Handling**:
    *   Kotlin Data Classes for robust domain modeling.
    *   JSON (de)serialization (e.g., using kotlinx.serialization or Gson/Moshi with Retrofit).

## üöÄ Getting Started

The project is under active development. The current focus is on building out the core UI for the magazine section and planning the architecture for upcoming features.

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Latest stable version (e.g., Iguana, Hedgehog or newer is highly recommended).
- **Android SDK**: API Level 21 (Lollipop) or higher for the target device/emulator.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher (usually bundled with recent Android Studio versions).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open" and navigate to the cloned `RetroHub` project directory.
3.  **Gradle Sync & Build:**
    *   Android Studio will automatically sync the project with its Gradle files. This may take a few minutes for the first time as dependencies are downloaded.
    *   Once synced, build the project by selecting `Build > Make Project` or by attempting to run the app.
4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Select an available Android Emulator (with API 21+) or connect a physical Android device (ensure USB Debugging is enabled in Developer Options).
    *   Click the "Run 'app'" button (the green play icon) in the Android Studio toolbar.

## üìñ Usage (Current Functionality & Envisioned Flow)

**Currently Implemented (Early Stage):**
*   **Magazine Shelf View (`MagazinesScreen`):**
    *   The main screen displays a retro-styled title "VIRTUAL MAGAZINES".
    *   Users can see scrollable virtual shelves populated with sample magazine covers.
    *   Magazine covers are designed to be clickable, with navigation to a reader view being the next step in development.

**Envisioned User Experience:**
1.  **App Launch & Dashboard**: Users will be greeted by a visually engaging dashboard providing clear entry points to the "Articles," "Magazines," and "Albums" sections.
2.  **Section Navigation**: Tapping on a section will lead to a dedicated screen optimized for browsing that type of content (e.g., filterable lists for articles, grid views for albums, shelf views for magazines).
3.  **Content Interaction**:
    *   **Articles**: Seamless reading experience with embedded images and clear typography.
    *   **Magazines**: An immersive reader allowing page-flipping (swipe gestures) and zoom capabilities.
    *   **Albums**: A dedicated audio player with standard controls (play/pause, skip, shuffle, repeat), tracklist display, and background playback.
4.  **User Account Management (Post-Login)**:
    *   A dedicated user profile screen.
    *   Access to saved/bookmarked content.
    *   Clear pathways to content contribution forms (e.g., "Upload Magazine," "Write Article").
