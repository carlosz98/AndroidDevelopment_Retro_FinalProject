## Overview
RetroHub is an Android application, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, designed as a vibrant portal for enthusiasts of retro video games, software, hardware, and their iconic soundtracks. It aims to be a community-driven hub where users can discover, explore, and engage with content spanning classic eras to contemporary retro-inspired creations.

The app currently features a distinct retro-themed **Home Screen** that welcomes users and provides navigation to core content sections: **Albums**, **Magazines**, and **Articles**. The project leverages modern Android development practices, emphasizing a clean, immersive retro aesthetic (vaporwave/synthwave influences) and a user-friendly interface. Future development will focus on populating these sections with rich content, implementing user accounts, and enabling community contributions.

## üåü Features

**Core User Interface & Navigation:**
- **üè† Home Screen (`HomeScreen`):**

    *   Features scrollable virtual shelves populated with sample magazine covers.
    *   Magazine covers are clickable, preparing for navigation to a reader view.
- **üì∞ Articles & Reviews (Planned UI):**
    *   UI design planned for browsing articles related to retro video games, software, hardware, and industry history.
- **üé∂ Albums & Soundtracks (Planned UI):**
    *   UI design planned for discovering and streaming soundtracks, viewing game/composer details, and album art.

**User & Community Features (Planned for Future Phases):**

    *   Specific color palettes (`RetroTextOffWhite`, `VaporwavePink`, `VaporwaveBlue`, `VaporwaveCyan`, `VaporwavePurple`, `SynthwaveOrange`).
    *   UI elements like text shadows (`Shadow` API), gradient backgrounds (`Brush.horizontalGradient`).
    *   Rounded corners, borders, and carefully chosen typography sizes and weights.
- **üì± Modern Android Stack**: Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose (Material 3).
- **üñºÔ∏è Rich Media Presentation**:
    *   Dynamic GIF display on the Home screen using **Coil**.
    *   Placeholders and design for showcasing magazine covers, article imagery, and album artwork.
- **Intuitive Navigation**:

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts (Current & Planned)

- **Language**: Kotlin (100%)
- **Core Android & Jetpack Libraries**:
    *   **Jetpack Compose**: UI Toolkit (Material 3, Layouts, Foundation, Graphics, Animation).
        *   `AsyncImage` (from Coil) for image and GIF loading.
        *   `ClickableText` for interactive text elements (e.g., blog link).
        *   Custom Modifiers (e.g., for text shadows - though direct `TextStyle.shadow` is used).
    *   **`WebView` (via `AndroidView`)**: Planned for initial display of web-based magazine content.
    *   **ExoPlayer / Android Media3 (Planned)**: For robust audio streaming of game soundtracks.
    *   **Room Database (Planned)**: For local caching.
    *   **Retrofit / Ktor (Planned)**: For backend API communication.
    *   **Jetpack Navigation Compose (Partially Implemented - Manual State Management Currently Used)**: Full adoption planned.
    *   **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous operations.
    *   **Coil**: For efficient image loading and caching (covers, article images, album art, GIFs).
    *   **Hilt / Koin (Planned)**: For dependency injection.
- **Backend Infrastructure (Conceptual - Requires Separate Development)**:
    *   RESTful API (Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Kotlin/Ktor, etc.).
    *   Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
    *   Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Firebase Storage, etc.).
- **UI/UX Principles**:
    *   Declarative UI paradigm with Jetpack Compose.
    *   State Hoisting and Unidirectional Data Flow.
    *   Material Design 3 guidelines adapted to the retro theme.
- **Data Handling**:
    *   Kotlin Data Classes.
    *   JSON (de)serialization (e.g., kotlinx.serialization).
